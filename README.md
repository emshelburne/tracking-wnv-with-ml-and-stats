# Mosquito Surveillance & West Nile Virus Analysis

This project analyzes mosquito surveillance data from Chicago (2008â€“2019) to study environmental, temporal, and biological drivers of mosquito abundance and West Nile Virus (WNV) presence.

## Overview
- **Part 1 (Cleaning & EDA):** Data wrangling, seasonal trend exploration, species vs. WNV prevalence, and trap type comparisons.  
- **Part 2 (Statistical Analysis):**  
  - Exploratory correlations and hypothesis testing  
  - **Linear regression:** modeling mosquito abundance  
  - **Logistic regression:** predicting WNV presence  

## Key Findings
- Seasonal and spatial patterns strongly influence mosquito populations.  
- Species differ significantly in WNV positivity rates.  
- Logistic regression achieved an F1 score of **0.62** after threshold tuning, showing predictive value despite class imbalance.  

## Skills & Tools
- Python (pandas, Plotly, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Data cleaning, EDA, regression modeling, statistical testing  
- Public health data analysis & visualization
